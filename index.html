    <h2>Personal Statement</h2>
    <p> I am a versatile professional with over a decade of experience spanning multiple industries, 
        cultures, and languages. My journey began as an export clerk in a logistics company, 
        where I honed my organizational and communication skills for five years. 
        Seeking new challenges, I moved to Mexico and served as an Operations Manager 
        in a digital fabric printing factory, where I not only expanded my management expertise 
        but also learned to communicate effectively in Spanish.

    <p> Upon returning to Hong Kong, my career took an exciting turn as I joined a hospital's 
        clinical ward of geriatrics, working in out-patient clinics and outreach service schemes 
        related to child and adolescent psychiatry. The experience in earning my Advanced Diploma 
        in Business Information Technology ignited my passion in technology industry and led me to 
        my current role as a junior full-stack web developer at the School of Medicine in the 
        University of Hong Kong. These qualifications have equipped me with the knowledge and skills 
        necessary to excel in various sectors and adapt quickly to new environments.</p>
